MA CVS Setup

Advice.

It's best to keep the same directory structure as your CVS Root.
For example dragonfly uses /cvs: :pserver:anonymous@cpgnuke.com:/cvs
So on our website it is http://dragonflycms.org/cvs/

If you use a different path like :pserver:anonymous@domain.com:/mycvs
Then you should use http://domain.com/mycvs/

Step 1.

modify config.php and .htaccess to your server setup.

Step 2.

upload all content to a subdirectory of your Dragonfly install.
example:
/index.php = Dragonfly
/cvs/* = this content
