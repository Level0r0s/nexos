GPL Additional Notes

  Linking NexOS CMS statically or dynamically with other modules is
  making a combined work based on NexOS CMS.  Thus, the terms and
  conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

  As a special exception, the copyright holders of NexOS CMS give you
  permission to link NexOS CMS with independent modules that communicate
  with NexOS CMS solely through the NexOS Core interface, regardless of
  the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
  resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that
  every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of
  the source code of NexOS CMS (the version of NexOS CMS used to
  produce the combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU
  General Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a module
  which is not derived from or based on NexOS CMS.

  Note that people who make modified versions of NexOS CMS are not
  obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
  their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General Public License gives
  permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
  exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
  carries forward this exception.
