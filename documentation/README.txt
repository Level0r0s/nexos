Thank you for downloading NexOS CMS! We hope that you can enjoy our
remarkable software... we sure do!

  What is NexOS CMS?

NexOS CMS is a powerful, feature-rich advanced content management system
based on NexOS CMS. We have spent nearly three years developing NexOS
CMS, paying particular attention to security and stability. The release of
NexOS 1.0 marks yet another milestone in our history.

Our software is written in PHP — the fastest programming language
spreading the net today — combined with your choice of either MySQL,
mysqli or PostgreSQL.

  Why NexOS CMS?

Unlike other content management systems on the net, we maintain a high
standard of security, so that you spend time managing your site, instead
of it's software. We make managing your site easy with our line of
powerful tools, including a debugging system, BBCode support in many
site areas, a built-in photo gallery, and phpBB 2.0.x integrated.

Please remember that NexOS CMS is free software, as such we do not offer
any warranty or guaranteed technical support. You are always welcome to
