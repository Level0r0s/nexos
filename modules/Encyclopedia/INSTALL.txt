This module is easy to install with no hassle from SQL files. It's a new
system we release in Dragonfly to make it easier for everyone.

Just upload the content of this zip to your "root" directory:
modules => modules
blocks  => blocks
etc.
You may be warned: "Do you want to overwrite the folders?"... just say yes;
these won't replace or remove the wrong files.

Login as admin and go to the "Modules" page, which will autodetect the new
module and checks if cpg_inst.php file exists, and if so it will "include"
that file.

The cpg_inst.php runs the necessary SQL commands to setup the tables and make
the appropriate changes to the database.

When you see the module in the list of modules, everything is setup and you
can begin to use it.

That's all!
